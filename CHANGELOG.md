[README](README.md) for new usage instructions.

### Breaking Changes

- Requires PHP 7.4.

- Requires Slim 4.0 for Slim related features.
- Removed `removeEmpty` filter. Use `|filter(v => v)` or define `array_filter`
  as a filter in your extension instead.
- Removed `PhpDebugBar` extension. Use a PSR middleware such as
  `php-middleware/debugbar` or `middlewares/debugbar` instead.
- Removed `TwigLoaderError` middleware. `TwigLoaderErrorHandler` should be used
  instead. Usage instructions are in [README](README.md#handling-not-found-errors).

## [0.5.3] - 2018-12-06

### Bugfixes

## [0.5.2] - 2018-12-06

### Bugfixes

- Fix `TwigNotFoundHandler`

## [0.5.1] - 2018-12-06

This release introduces a temporary fix for Slim component not working with
PHP-DI.

Currently PHP-DI doesn't support `class_alias()`, which means that
`Twig_Environment` gets injected instead of `Twig\Environment`. To fix this all
classes depending on `Twig\Environment` have been changed to use
`Twig_Environment` instead. They might be changed back in the future once PHP-DI
gets fixed. See http://bit.ly/2SsA5Rh for the issue.

## [0.5.0] - 2018-12-05

### Breaking changes

Pretty much everything has changed. Backwards incompatible with previous
version. Repository got messed up. Had to rebase. Previous versions might not
be available anymore (missing tags).

### Added

- Slim component with various Slim Twig integration helpers.
- New filters: HtmlPurify, RemoveEmpty.
- Refactor TwigExtension

## [0.4.0] - 2018-10-15

### Added

#### FormatDateRange

- Now accepts `DateTime` objects in addition to strings.
- Can now specify a custom delimiter string (default `-`)

### Added

- `FormatDateRange`: Option to always include year in the returned date.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-04-24
